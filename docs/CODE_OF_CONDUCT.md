## Programming Code Of Ethics
This article attempts to enumerate the key points of proper conduct for Computer Programmers.  
Much of this is based on the Code Of Ethics of the now defunct International Programmers Guild and githubs code of conduct tamplate.

A programmer and community member **must never **:

* create or distribute malware.
* write code that is obfuscated or intentionally difficult to follow.
* write documentation that is intentionally confusing or inaccurate.
* reuse copyrighted code unless the proper license is purchased or permission is obtained.
* acknowledge (verbally and in source code comments) the work of other programmers on which the code is based, even if substantial changes are made.
* write code that is deliberately inefficient with the intent of later claiming credit for making efficiency improvements.
* intentionally introduce bugs with the intent of later claiming credit for fixing the bugs, or to stimulate the uptake of later versions.
* write code that intentionally breaks another programmer's code for the purpose of elevating one's status.
* hide known obstacles to a project's completion during any phase of development, especially the design phase.
* dishonestly downplay the difficulty of completing a project.
* report any illegal activities of the member.
* defame the profession.
* falsely deny the presence of bugs.
* accept compensation from multiple parties for the same work unless permission is given.
* conceal pertinent information from other members of the development team.
* conceal from the author/maintainer their financial interest in development resources.
* conceal any conflict of interest that may affect the project.
* seek external profit from a project that was funded by a second party without permission.  If permission is given to resell a product, the work should be discounted.
* maliciously injure the reputation of an members of the development team.
* misrepresent their knowledge, experience, or abilities.
* take credit for another's work.
* steal software, especially development tools.
* conceal the deficiencies of other programmers by writing code for them and allowing them to pass it off as their own work.
* install third-party applications without the user's permission.  Preferably not at all.
* stay obsolete on the advancement of the field of Computer Science.
* force updates on a user without their knowledge and approval.
* intimidate, stalk or follow(online or in person)
* threat with violence or violent language directed against another person.
* make sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
* post or display sexually explicit or violent material.
* post or threat to post other peopleâ€™s personally identifying information ("doxing").
* personaly insult, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
* post inappropriate photography or recording.

* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible.
## Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify Gits2501 with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.
